<p>We decided to go with Wordpress using ACF for a custom admin page builder. It is a really easy to use CMS and has great scalability for adding new features in the future.</p>

<p>The site required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to Enquire about services</li>
  <li>Newsletter integration with Mailchimp</li>
  <li>Ability to add video Testimonials and embed them withing content</li>
  <li>A teams page</li>
  <li>Blog functionality</li>
</ul>
