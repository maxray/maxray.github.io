I"Ã<p>When in a role where you oversee other designer/developers and help mould the companies use of technology it is important to be like a sponge when it comes to researching new techniques and ways of working. </p>
<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint</a> by Jake Knapp (thanks for bringing it to my attention <a href="https://twitter.com/seanuk" target="_blank">@sean_uk</a>) and came across the concept of 'Crazy 8s'. I think this method offers a really great, quick way for designers to validate their ideas before they commit to their design programme of choice or start writing some code.
