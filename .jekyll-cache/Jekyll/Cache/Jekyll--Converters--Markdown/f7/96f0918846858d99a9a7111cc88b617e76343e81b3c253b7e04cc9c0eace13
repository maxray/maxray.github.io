<p><strong>It had been a long time in discussion. Dates came and went with all manner of reasons and excuses. Finally after reading about "THE #MICROADVENTURE 2013 CHALLENGE" commitment was made, days were booked off work and the proper planning began.</strong></p>
<p>The first choice was the location and Crickhowell became an early front runner due to having a route over Crug Mawr that had been aborted 3 times due to mechanical or weather based problems. As the days went on though the weather didn't look like it was going to be great so a back up location of Church Stretton was also decided upon so that we could go where the weather might be kindest.
