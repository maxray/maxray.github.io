<p>We decided to go with Wordpress on this build. The client had used  Wordpress before and being non technical was keen to keep things as familiar as possible.</p>

<p>Looking at the sites functionality we required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to Enquire about artwork</li>
  <li>Responsive for all devices</li>
  <li>Archives for Artists and Work</li>
  <li>An Exhibitions page to feature work.</li>
</ul>
