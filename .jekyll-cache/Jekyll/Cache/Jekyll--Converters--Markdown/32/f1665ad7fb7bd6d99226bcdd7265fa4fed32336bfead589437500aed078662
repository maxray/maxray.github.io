<p><img src="//uploads/birm_beer_week.png" alt="Birmingham Beer Week" /></p>

<p>With a rich brewing history that is evolving into a forward thinking craft beer haven, #BrumBW17 will be bringing together the cityâ€™s finest breweries, pubs, bars, bottle shops and restaurants. Creating a whole array of fun and exciting events, with good music, food and of course GREAT BEER!</p>

<p>It has been a pleasure to work with Krishan, Tim, Beeryeti and Kerrie on this project and hopefully we will get to develop the concept further for 2018 :)</p>

<p>The site is a very simple MVP this year, although it was good fun to map the brewers and venues using Google Maps. I will document this in a post soon.</p>
