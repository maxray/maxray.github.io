But what about those that canâ€™t?</h3>

<p>Our founder, youth and community worker Matt Kendall, died from cancer aged just 35.  Knowing he didnâ€™t have long, he set up the Foundation to carry on his work with young people in Birmingham to help them realise their potential.</p>

<p>As my daughter was in Mattâ€™s class at school I felt compelled to offer my skills to help get the Foundation website up and running as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>There is lotâ€™s we would like to do going forward but for now we can spread the word and allow young people to apply for grants.</p>
