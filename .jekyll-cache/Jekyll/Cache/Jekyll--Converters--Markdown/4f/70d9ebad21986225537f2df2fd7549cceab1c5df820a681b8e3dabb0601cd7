<p>After an initial kickoff meeting with the client by video ( we were just getting into the lockdown) I got to work taking the brand guidelines and information from the meeting to develop a visual style for the site.</p>

<p>With a killer set of colours and the really interesting shapes the concept came together quite quickly. Some people will probably think it old fashioned but I really love working in a dot grid pad with some highlighters to develop initial ideas. It is so quick to iterate and there is no danger of the client viewing them as final mock ups. They are precious and disposable at the same time!</p>

<p>I came up with some really quick hand drawn concepts which conveyed enough to get into the browser and begin working with a real prototype. I needed to build the admin tools to allow us to populate the site whilst the build of the theme was taking place. This may seem a bit rushed but developing a site with real content is exactly what you want to be doing!</p>

<h3 id="hitting-the-deadline">Hitting the deadline</h3>

<p>As mentioned it was a really quick turn around with a hard deadline as the Collect 2020 Exhibition was starting on the 27th February regardless. With a little help from one of his key artists (Freya Pocklington) to advise on some details relating to artists the site was ready to go on time. Freya said; “Fergus can’t stop saying how delighted he is with the website. I can imagine he’s been flat out this week with being at Collect.”.</p>
