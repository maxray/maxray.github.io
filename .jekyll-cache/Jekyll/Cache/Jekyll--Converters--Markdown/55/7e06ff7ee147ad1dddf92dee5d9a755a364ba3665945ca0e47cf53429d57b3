We had been snorkelling every day, learning where the best spots were at our local beach and a couple of spots further afield.Â </strong></p>
<p>We made plans for the last day, a kayaking trip across the bay to an island that we had heard was a beach turtles lay eggs on. After seeing one on one of our morning swims we were keen to get over and see what it was like.</p>
<p>I wasn't quite prepared for what followed when I woke up in the middle of the night.
