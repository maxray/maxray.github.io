<p>Surprisingly it has taken nearly a year of working closely with a team for me to get annoyed with something! I am taking this as a good thing, because up until Thursday I don’t think a cross word was said - unless it was behind my back!</p>

<p>In hindsight I had been bad in some of my comms, probably an effect of becoming over familiar so it has been a kick to get back to being professional at all times.</p>

<p>I did my first shift at the Art Rooms on Wednesday, keeping an eye whilst people came in to create and look at the work on display. I had an epic bagel from the guys at AV Coffee a new shop on our high street… shall definitely be going there again.</p>
