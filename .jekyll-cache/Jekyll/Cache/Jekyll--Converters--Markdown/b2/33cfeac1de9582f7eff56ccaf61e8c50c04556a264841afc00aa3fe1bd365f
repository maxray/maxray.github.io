I"¨<p><strong>I must say</strong> at the outset that printmaking is not something entirely new to me. I did my degree in Illustration and had a Foundation year before that with a real focus on the print room. When I heard from a friend about Birmingham Printmakers it re ignited the fire in my belly and I did a refresher workshop to remind me what was involved. There is nothing quite like getting covered in paint and mucking about in a dark room, and an added bonus of you walk out of the studio with some half decent looking prints at the end of it.</p>

<p>The print studio is small, only 2 beds and a dark room for screen work and is Members only meaning that you can access it as nearly any hour of the day.</p>

<p>I used my Imagine Day to take my Workshop induction, so took along a few illustrations hastily printed onto transparencies and an open mind.</p>

<h3>The process all came flooding back; </h3>

<p>First you need to coat your frame in order to expose your design onto it. Exposure takes about 55 seconds for a transparency on a big huge light box. The Screen is then washed to leave the design etched in place.</p>

<p>Next you need to prepare your screen bed whilst the screen dries, choose some inks, grab a squeegee etc. Time for the fun part, seeing how the design lays onto the paper and setting them to dry before getting the next layer of screen design ready.</p>

<p>There is a lot of cleaning, although as you are usually waiting for a screen to dry it fits together nicely meaning you can achieve quite a lot during a day.</p>

<p>What is great about doing this is it is a real antidote to the day to day programming and project managing I do, but while it is destressing and fun as an employee it also starts to add extra skills to the studio that the company could call upon further down the line.</p>

<p>So who needs a Tote bag or a poster printing?!</p>
