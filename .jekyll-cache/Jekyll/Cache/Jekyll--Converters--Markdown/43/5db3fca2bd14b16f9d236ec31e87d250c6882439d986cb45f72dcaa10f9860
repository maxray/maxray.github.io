I"º<p>Alveston Fine Arts was set up in 2016 to promote talented British and Irish artists.
  Represented artists bring something unique to their craft, striving to change how we look at conventional art forms by using materials in imaginative ways. They all bring fresh methods and ideas to their work.</p>

<p>The brief was to design something interesting, ideally avoiding the super minimal gallery style that often goes with art websites. There was a logo in development and the client was keen to keep a maroon colour used in some existing exhibition graphics and other printed collateral. One big thing was that it was only weeks until a big exhibition so Fergus needed a speedy turn around.</p>
