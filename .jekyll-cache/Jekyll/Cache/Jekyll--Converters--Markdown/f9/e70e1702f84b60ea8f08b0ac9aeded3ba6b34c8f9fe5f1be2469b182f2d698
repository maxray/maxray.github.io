<p>I can’t decide how I am going to document things so for now, I am keeping the first few days here. 
<!--more--> </p>

<p>Day 1 for my was actually Day 2 but hey shhhh..  :)</p>

<h3 id="day-1---iran">Day 1 - IRAN</h3>

<p>A little searching brought up Khoresh Bademjan, but the recipe used Sour grapes which I could not find. Thankfully some more searching showed that you can substitute with unripe gooseberries which I could get.</p>

<p>This is a beef and aubergine stew essentially and I followed this <a href="https://persianmama.com/khoresh-bademjan-persian-eggplant-stew-with-beef/">recipe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="day-2---france">Day 2 - FRANCE</h3>

<p>It had been a busy day and there was arguments about what we were having for dinner anyway. Decided to go safe so we chose <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/_chicken_chasseur_with_19163">chicken chasseur</a>. It is years since I have had it and it hit the spot! I think this one will be returning to the family meal list.</p>

<h3 id="day-3---switzerland">Day 3 - SWITZERLAND</h3>

<p>Sunday dinner was not going to be missed, so we decided on a pudding instead.. Swiss meringues. Biggest fail ever, me and Meg making an absolute hash of it all and ending up with a sticky, gooey, tasty mess that wasn’t really close to what it should have been.</p>

<h3 id="day-4---tunisia">Day 4 - TUNISIA</h3>

<p>We do a slightly lax 5:2 eating regime in our house so Monday was just a light supper… best find so far! <a href="http://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/shakshuka">Shaksuka</a> is kind of like baked eggs in a tomato and pepper base.</p>

<h3 id="day-5---egypt">Day 5 - EGYPT</h3>

<p>I seem to be in the habit of cursing the team I pick in this fun game, Egypt played poorly but this recipe with <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/egyptian-courgettes-dukkah-sprinkle">courgettes and a dukkah sprinkle</a> was really interesting and also vegan if that’s your thing.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/dukkah-2fd194.jpg" alt="dukkah-2fd194.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="day-6---spain">Day 6 - SPAIN</h3>

<p>The pressure of new meals was getting to me a bit so took an easy option of Paella. What’s not to like.. rice, sea food ooh and some chorizo :P</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/paella-55e276.jpg" alt="paella-55e276.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="day-7---peru">Day 7 - PERU</h3>

<p>Back to a semi fast day, so although <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/tacu-tacu/">Tacu Tacu</a> is often used as a side with a meat main I thought we should try it having never eaten Plantain. What a revelation, fried plantain was much more like potato than I expected. The hot sauce and chilli made this one that the kids were reluctant to get involved with. :)</p>

<p>Apparently this is a good hangover meal too, though I could imagine it partnering with a crisp IPA myself.</p>

<p>And so ends Week 1 of the World Cup, some great games, and England victory and some lovely new additions to our family recipes. Let’s hope for more of the same next week!</p>
