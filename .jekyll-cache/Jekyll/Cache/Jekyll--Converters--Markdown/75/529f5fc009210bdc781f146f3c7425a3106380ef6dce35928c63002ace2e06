<p>Well things have been pretty hectic this week, mainly due to me making commitments to things on top of my freelance and agency work.</p>

<p>The KingsheathCIC have finally signed the lease on the old Denmanâ€™s light shop on the high street so finally our community art project can begin! This has the potential to be super exciting and really good for the community but first we need to make the building water tight and safe. A water butt from my allotment saved a flood and we have all got stuck in pruning back weeds, pulling up floors and begging and borrowing furniture.</p>

<p>This week was the 2nd Birmingham Design Festival - I volunteer for this despite it mainly being students and me being like the old man of the sea as I love to get a chance to talk to other designers and developers from our city. I made a few new connections and heard some good talks too.</p>

<p>I ended my hectic week having a chat to none other than Andy Clarke - yeah the web overlord who has written books and generally pushed the web on alongside the likes of Jeffery Zeldman and Paul Boag. It felt a little surreal chatting shop and discussing some potential work (sorry its a secret) but was a great way to end the week.</p>
