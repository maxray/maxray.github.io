I"¿<p>Surely I canâ€™t be the only oneâ€¦ you read a bit about <a href="http://www.davidco.com/" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) and think â€œYeah this is exactly what I need.. I will be so efficient and organised!â€</p>
<p>Then a lack of time (or dedication) Â and a serial app trying addiction means you use a written list one day and before you know it your app of choice is a pile of non actioned items and is more hindrance than a help. Then you see someone singing the praises of another simpler app.. â€œThis is it!!â€ you think and once again you lapse and donâ€™t stay on top of things and another app bites the dust.</p>
<p>I have decided to take the power back though and think I have devised a workable plan that I can stick to, once I have performed a spring clean of my chosen apps that is.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell I think Any.do and Evernote can cover all my needs and so I am going to drop the others and try and focus on using these 2 well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> will house my links, blog ideas and documents and <a href="http://www.any.do/" target="_blank">Any.do</a> will just take care of my day to day action list. </p>
<p>I think my biggest problem is managing to keep to my plan. If anyone has any great suggestions* as how to do this please let me know!</p>
<p><em>* I may have neglected to finish reading GTD so Â the answer may well be sitting waiting for me to read! Â :)</em></p>
