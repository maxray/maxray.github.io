I"á<p>I watched a Vimeo post (via <a href="https://twitter.com/jonikorpi" target="_blank">@jonikorpi</a>) 6 years ago - literally to the day, Â <a href="http://vimeo.com/59679411" target="_blank">Hartmut Esslinger - Advice For Designers</a>Â andÂ realised that there were someÂ parallelsÂ in there towards how I think weÂ shouldÂ approach web design.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2019 and has much changed? Yeah we may be using a few different tools but the concepts still hold water.
