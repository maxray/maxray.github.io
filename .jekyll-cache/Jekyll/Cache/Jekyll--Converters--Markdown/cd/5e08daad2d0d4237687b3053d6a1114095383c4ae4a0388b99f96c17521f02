<p>My aim of this tutorial was to try and open up the possibilities of writing progressive clean code <strong>AND</strong> making your life as a front-end developer less of a war with the browser and/or your design team.</p>

<p>If you are just starting out with CSS Grid I can‚Äôt recommend the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox Dev Tools</a> enough, it is so useful for seeing how your grid is reacting to content. You should also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/MicheBarks">Michelle Barker</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jensimmons">Jen Simmons</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a> and  <a href="https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw">Andy Bell</a> (creator of <a href="https://every-layout.dev/">every-layout.dev</a>) as they are all great sources of information and tutorials around front-end layout!</p>

<p>My dad would always say ‚Äúuse the right tool for the job‚Äù through tears as I used his expensive chisels to try and break rocks open to find fossils, sage advice and if the option is there for you to be flexible you might find using grid your perfect tool on your next web build.</p>
