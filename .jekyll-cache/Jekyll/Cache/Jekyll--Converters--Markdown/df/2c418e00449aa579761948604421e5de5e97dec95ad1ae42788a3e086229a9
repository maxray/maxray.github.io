I"_<p>Bank Holidays are good when you are employed but not so much when you are freelance! Had planned for this one anyway as it is Megs birthday so enjoyed a proper family day.</p>

<p>The weekend was interspersed with a few website dramas after having to launch a site just before the weekend.. lessons to be learned there!</p>

<p>Progress is good on the flooring website I am working on and I am in the design phase of a record label site which should be pretty fun!</p>

<p>Ended the week with the Birmingham Design Festival volunteer meeting - going to help out again as really enjoyed it last year.</p>
