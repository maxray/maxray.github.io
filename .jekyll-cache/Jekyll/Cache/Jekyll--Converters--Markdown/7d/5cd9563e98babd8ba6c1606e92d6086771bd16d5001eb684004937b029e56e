<p>Those who know me will be fully aware that I have a ‘thing’ for notepads. Moleskin, Rhodia, you name it if it has a nice texture and even better it is dot grid <strong>I AM IN!</strong> :)  My use of notepads however is a bit lame. I tend to write linear notes during the day that have little to no value 24hours after writing them so, despite continuing to do this I have always tried to use digital tools to manage my ‘to do’ lists properly.</p>

<p>I was put on to the idea of Bullet Journaling running up to Christmas and a few YouTube videos later my eyes were opened to a whole world of epic journalling.</p>

<p>So if I had a huge amount of spare time I could imagine me spending hours creating elaborate journal layouts and tracking all sorts of things but I have way too many interests and kids and all that goes with it so I have tried to take enough of the basics to get me by and aim to get some consistency…  the elaborate month pages can come later!</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>

<p>The most basic principles are to use an index, a month page to list important things and tasks to be done and then a weekly page that deals with the tasks themselves. You use symbols to signify the type of note, be it a task, event or birthday and then cross them off once complete or move them over to the next day or week if they are postponed.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-think">What I think</h3>

<p>Interestingly it is the act of slowing things down and committing to a medium without an “Undo” shortcut that I think is helping me to manage things better. I take a little time on a Sunday afternoon to draw out the coming week, transfer and cross out tasks and check other sources such as the family calendar for any sneaky events.</p>

<p>Trello and the like offer so much functionality that should make managing my tasks a breeze - but the fact it is so instant means thing get forgotten or put off and suddenly another board is condemned to the Trello graveyard of ignored boards.</p>

<p>Either way I have managed to stay on top fo things for the first two months of the year… will I be doing a Bullet Journal update in December? **I hope so. **</p>
