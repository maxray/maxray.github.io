<p>Those who know me will be fully aware that I have a ‘thing’ for notepads. Moleskin, Rhodia, you name it if it has a nice texture and even better it is dot grid I AM IN! :)  My use of notepads however is a bit lame. I tend to write linear notes during the day that have little to no value 24hours after writing them so, despite continuing to do this I have always tried to use digital tools to manage my ‘to do’ lists properly.</p>

<p>I was put on to the idea of Bullet Journaling running up to Christmas and a few YouTube videos later my eyes were openend to a whle world of epic journalling.</p>

<h4 id="you-can-get-pretty-into-journalling">You can get pretty into Journalling</h4>

<p>So if I had a huge amount of spare time I could imagine me spending hours creating elaborate journal layouts and tracking all sorts of things but I have way too many interests and kids and all that goes with it so I have tried to take enough of the basics to get me by and aim to get some consistency…  the elaborate month pages can come later!</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>

<p>The most basic principles are to have an index, a month page to list important things and tasks to be done and then a weekly page that deals with the tasks themselves. You use symbols to signify the type of note, be it a task, event or birthday and then cross them off once complete or move them over to the next day or week if they are postponed.</p>
