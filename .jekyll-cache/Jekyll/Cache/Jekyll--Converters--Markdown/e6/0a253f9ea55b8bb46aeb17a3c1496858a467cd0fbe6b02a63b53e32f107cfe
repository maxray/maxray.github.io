<p>I was keen to use a rapid process on this project and thankfully Fergus was willing to let me lead and trusted me to deliver a site that would work and be easy to manage.</p>

<p>Fergus was very keen to keep the maroon colour which initially I wasnâ€™t sure about but by balancing it with a healthy amount of white space it works well.</p>

<p>I came up with some really quick hand drawn concepts which conveyed enough to get into the browser and begin working with a real prototype. I needed to build the admin tools to allow us to populate the site whilst the build of the theme was taking place. This may seem a bit rushed but developing a site with real content is exactly what you want to be doing!</p>
