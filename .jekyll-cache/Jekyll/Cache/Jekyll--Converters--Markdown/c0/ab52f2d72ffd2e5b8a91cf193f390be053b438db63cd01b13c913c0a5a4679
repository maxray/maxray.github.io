I"j<p>When in a role where you oversee other designer/developers and help mould the companies use of technology it is important to be like a sponge when it comes to researching new techniques and ways of working. </p>
<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint</a> by Jake Knapp (thanks for bringing it to my attention <a href="https://twitter.com/seanuk" target="_blank">@sean_uk</a>) and came across the concept of 'Crazy 8s'. I think this method offers a really great, quick way for designers to validate their ideas before they commit to their design programme of choice or start writing some code.

<p>The concept is simple. You take the idea you intend to work up into a concept or design and then iterate 8 alternatives in 8 minutes.</p>

<p>It forces you to move past your initial assumptions (which may well be correct) and consider alternative solutions.</p>

<h3>I'm crazy me...</h3>

<p>I am not a big fan of the name, which refers to the speed at which you have to work through the ideas but love the concept. Perhaps "Valid8s" is how I might refer to them going forward.</p>

<p>These designs are not to share with others for critique but just to validate the idea before you commit time and effort.</p>

<h3>How do you do it?</h3>

<p>Simply fold a piece of A4 paper 3 times in order to make 8 rectangles. Then set your phone timer to 60 seconds and work through the panels producing quick rough alternative sketches.</p>

<p>This method could also work for straplines, call to action buttons or even colour palettes!</p>
<p>As if often the case you may find that your initial hunch still stands, but for 8 minutes extra effort you have potentially saved yourself a world of pain when you realise your 75% complete design doesn't quite work and need to backtrack.</p>
