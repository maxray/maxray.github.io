I"û<h3 id="what-a-weird-week">What a weird week!</h3>

<p>The week ended before it had began. After a weekend feeling a little bit of a niggle in my right knee I awoke on Monday in absolute agony. I couldnâ€™t bend me leg or really walk - and trying to carry on and get ready to go into town left me feeling like I would puke. :( Monday and Tuesday were essentially written off and made me realise the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your health is the number 1 important thing in life</li>
  <li>Thinking that because you work on a laptop you can work just fine with any other illness is bullshit..</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily by Wednesday I could just about walk, and so the motorbike went in for a service and now runs as sweet as.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday were a rise back to a good end to the week.. I was contacted about going on a podcast (woo) and will hopefully be having a chat with someone I have followed/listened to throughout my career in web about some potential workâ€¦ will wait to see if this materialises.</p>
