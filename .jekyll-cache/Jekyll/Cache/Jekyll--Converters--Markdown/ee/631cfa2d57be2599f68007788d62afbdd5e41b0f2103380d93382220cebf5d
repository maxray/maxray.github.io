<p>Listening to this weekâ€™s <a href="http://upfrontpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Upfront podcast</a>Â  (well worth checking out) with <a href="http://jacksmith.is/" target="_blank">Jack Smith</a> and <a href="http://benhowdle.im/" target="_blank">Ben Howdle</a> it was pleasing to hear them mention still using Photoshop in the initial part of web projects. Up until this point the more I read about designing in the browser the more dirty I felt that I should still decide to use Photoshop as a starting point for web design.</p>
<p>It has been irking me somewhat and maybe I am missing a key element of the "how" of designing in browser but to be honest I struggle to see how it makes sense.
