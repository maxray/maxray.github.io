After being 16 seconds off my personal goal of a 25min 5k before lockdown I havenâ€™t run since. So obviously the best way to jump start things is by trying to run in some form for every day in September.</h3>

<p>I like to have some accountability so decided to document each day here. The 30 days went by pretty quickly, I only had a couple of days where I didnâ€™t fancy getting up to put my trainers on. One surprise was that there wasnâ€™t one rainy run in the whole monthâ€¦ in September! :S</p>

<p>I had the company of my daughter on recovery runs as she is doing the c25k so got a bit of father/daughter bonding in as a bonus.</p>

<p>Although I am looking forward to a couple of rest days to recharge a little I can see me sticking with a 3-4 run a week schedule, my mental health was the best it has been in the whole of 2020 which is probably my biggest take away from it all.</p>
