<p>As users we generally donâ€™t enjoy filling in forms online. This is down to a number of reasons. Forms tend to be time consuming, we are already thinking about the product or service that lies beyond the thankyou page and want to get there as quickly and easily as possible. Forms often seem complicated, and the increased cognitive load it puts on us makes completing the actions needed even harder. And then of course there is the risks and issues around personal data. Everyone is now much more aware of GDPR and anyway why do you really need to know my birthday for me to sign up for this service!?</p>

<p>Forms are the key touch point between our users and us, so it is odd that they tend to be neglected by designers, you have done all the hard work to sell your product or service and then force the user to prove themselves worthy by navigating a long drawn out form with obscure error messages and input fields.</p>

<p>With this in mind, what steps can we take when building these touch points for our users that will make the process simpler and generally more enjoyable.</p>
