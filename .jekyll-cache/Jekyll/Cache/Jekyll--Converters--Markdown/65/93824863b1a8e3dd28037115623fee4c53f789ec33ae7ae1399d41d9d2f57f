I"i<p><strong>I must say</strong> at the outset that printmaking is not something entirely new to me. I did my degree in Illustration and had a Foundation year before that with a real focus on the print room. When I heard from a friend about Birmingham Printmakers it re ignited the fire in my belly and I did a refresher workshop to remind me what was involved. There is nothing quite like getting covered in paint and mucking about in a dark room, and an added bonus of you walk out of the studio with some half decent looking prints at the end of it.</p>
