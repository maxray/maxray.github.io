We had been snorkelling every day, learning where the best spots were at our local beach and a couple of spots further afield.Â </strong></p>
<p>We made plans for the last day, a kayaking trip across the bay to an island that we had heard was a beach turtles lay eggs on. After seeing one on one of our morning swims we were keen to get over and see what it was like.</p>
<p>I wasn't quite prepared for what followed when I woke up in the middle of the night.<!--more--></p>
<p>At first I presumed I had maybe had a glass of wine too many, that familiar dizzy feeling accompanied by slight nausea. Better nip to the toilet, I am going to be the butt of the jokes tomorrow if I am sick I thought. Suddenly though I was lying on the cold marble floor, things were spinning like I had been strapped to a waltzer for a while, a feeling I became accustomed to over the following 6 hours.</p>

<p>By daylight I had spent the whole night crawling around the apartment, unable to stand and vomiting every 15 minutes or so, this was not how I intended to spend the last day of our Greek holiday!</p>
<p>Thankfully my wife's father and my brother in law were at hand and after a quick discussion it was decided to try and get me to a hospital about 25 minutes away. The main task now was how I was going to get from foetus position on a bed down to our hire car and survive the twisty drive to Pilos hospital. Sometimes you need to just go and find a special place inside you, it always amazes me what the human body and mind can achieve when push comes to shove.</p>
<p>We made it to the hospital with relative ease and soon I had been led into the A &amp; E Department and was seen quite promptly. Despite my disturbed vision and confusion I could tell that the place made the NHS hospitals I have been to in the UK look positively luxurious.</p>
<p>We did our best to answer the questions the doctors asked just as they did their best to understand our responses, it was hard work though.</p>
<p>They said they could only treat my symptoms, not the cause and so a prescription was written and my brother in law was sent off for some anti dizzyness pills whilst I lay in a room with a couple of other patients.</p>

<p>A couple of failed cardiograms using antiquated equipment later,Â a nurse entered and motioned to me to roll over, she was holding a syringe, evidently it had a meeting booked with my butt!</p>
<p>A rush of adrenaline helped to bring the relentless spinning into focus and I managed to decline the joys of an unknown injection until someone explained what it was for. Eventually the main doctor confirmed it was an anti vomiting injection, I was pretty happy to roll over and receive what turned out to be blessed relief.</p>
<p>I had had enough by now, I couldn't really work out what would happen if I missed my flight the next day, it was something that I couldn't let happen so when there was a quiet moment I suggested to my brother in law that we make an escape, I was soon being wheeled through the wards and got back into our car. Twenty minutes later I was at the relative safety of the villa and lay there wondering what the hell had just happened.</p>
<p>It turned out I had suffered a vertigo attack, something many people will experience in their lives. I had always associated it with a fear of heights, probably because of the Hitchcock film but it was actually most likely triggered by an inner ear infection from a virus and/or the snorkelling.</p>
<p>We made it home to Gatwick the next day, a very wobbly and confusing journey which, once again I was very thankful to have family around to assist me.</p>

<p>It took nearly two weeks to get to the point I could drive again properly but even 4 weeks on I can still feel the effects on my balance and spatial awareness meaning running or cycling is a struggle. A bit of internet research /doctors appointment suggests it could take a few months to get back to normal.</p>
<p>In the meantime though I still have our holiday snaps to go through and a autumn equinox #microadventure to plan, just gotta hope I am back to normal by then!</p>
