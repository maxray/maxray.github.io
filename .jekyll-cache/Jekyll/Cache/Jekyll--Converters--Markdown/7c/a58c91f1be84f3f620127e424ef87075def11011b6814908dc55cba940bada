I"<p>Speedy Wunderground is a label which started on February 25th 2013 with the release of “I Go Out” by Steve Mason &amp; Emiliana Torrini. Comprising of Dan Carey, Alexis Smith and Pierre Hall, they have been releasing some amazing tunes over the last 6 years.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of building their website way back then and it was most definitely showing its age and lacked any real functionality. A stop gap that lasted too long you might say. Luckily Speedy Wunderground were keen to revisit their site and improve the ecommerce aspect, they also had a few ideas about previewing tracks. Alexis and the team gave me a blank page to define the tech stack and with that in mind I suggested going with an approach that would minimise security issues and future updates.</p>
