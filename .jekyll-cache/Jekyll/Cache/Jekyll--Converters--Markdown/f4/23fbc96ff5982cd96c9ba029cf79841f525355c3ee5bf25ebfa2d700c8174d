<p>As I type this I am acutely aware of one thing...the clock .. time. I have come in a good 2 hours early to work in order to catch up on a few things but already when it is'n't even 07.30 I am watching the time drain away.</p>
<p>We all have increasingly busier lives. Technology helps (and possibly hinders us at times) meaning we live things 24/7. There is no time between something happening and pictures, videos and conversations on Twitter appearing... No time between taking a photo and seeing the result.. sometimesÂ feels... like there's... no... time... to breathe...
