I"Ô<p>I read an article this week by <a href="https://matthewcrist.com/" target="_blank">Michael Crist</a> in which he demonstrates why a Jobs to be done approach to development works better than Personas. ( https://hondo.wtf/posts/on-personas/)</p>

<p>There were some great points, notably the potential for biases which is inevitable especially with proto-personas.</p>

<p>I still however think that Personas offer a really valuable addition to the UX development process. They can act as a variance to a given user journey. Once you have drawn out the initial requirement or action on a site then personas help designers especially to think about the nuances that could make or break an experience for a certain demographic. </p>

<h3>User journeys, tasks and nuances.</h3>

<p>For example a path from Homepage to adding to a cart can be defined but then the use of personas based on the target user groups can help define, colours, tone of voice, text size and so on.</p>

<p><strong>‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm at the store with two kids, I want to checkout quickly, so I don‚Äôt have to chase them around‚Äù</strong> - Unless you have experienced that it gives you little to change how you approach the solution, you might aswell just revise it to <strong>‚ÄúI want to checkout quickly.‚Äù</strong> </p>

<p>As ever it is a case of using the tools available to you as and where they help rather than adhering to one method as the right and only solution.</p>
