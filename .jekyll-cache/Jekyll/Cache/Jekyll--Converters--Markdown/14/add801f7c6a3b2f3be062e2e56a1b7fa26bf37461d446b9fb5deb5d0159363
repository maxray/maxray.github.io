I"°<p>Sidekick had been undergoing an identity and branding revamp and as part of this required a new website moving from Squarespace over to Wordpress.</p>

<p>The website needed to be simple and easy to use and be responsive on different devices.</p>

<p>I was supplied a great branding document, detailing logo use, colour palette and the idea of vidsual patterns named â€œswopesâ€ to act as abstract details within the pages.</p>
