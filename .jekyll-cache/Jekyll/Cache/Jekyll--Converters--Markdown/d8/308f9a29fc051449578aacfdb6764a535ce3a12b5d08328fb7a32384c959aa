<p>After the big build up to the launch of the Art Rooms, this week was fairly low key. I have had to push a few projects around so have mainly been trying to take stock and re organise.</p>

<p>The next storm is just around the corner though as we are going on holiday on the 1st August and so begins both a panic to tie up work ends and also the nightmare of packing.</p>

<p>Currently looking for a good book to go with Sapiens and hunting for some sandals that are not too ‘old man’ :)</p>
