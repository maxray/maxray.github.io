I" <p>OpenActive is a community led initiative using data to help people get active in order to help reduce inactivity in England. Stewarded by the Open Data Institute (ODI) and supported by Sport England, its ambition is to get the sport and physical activity sector to publish and use data about the details of opportunities to be active.</p>

<p>As the community has grown, the ODI needed a new website that could serve its evolving needs. This project covered all the bases from the brands creation, user and stakeholder research, right through to the design and development of the site using a mixture of agile and waterfall techniques to get the project completed.</p>
