<p>People say a tidy desk tidy mind and the like and as much as I try to adhere to this tidy and clean way of existing I can't help stashing bits and bobs that seem like they might be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I'm not like a person you would see on the telly living in filth with 3feet of rubbish everywhere but as a designer I have a habit of keeping pictures, magazines and images in a badly organised fashion. I also love gadgets and so there are countless old phones, hard drives and pc/mac bits and bobs like an elephants graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>So today I was so pleased that for once my stashing and hoarding turned up trumps.
