<p>It wouldn't be right to end the year without a decent blast on the bike. I had been meaning to try and do a loop from my door with as little road as possible for ages and so it was time to quit the talk and actually get out and do it.</p>

<p>In true hipster style I started the morning with an Aeropress and porridge and got out into a pretty beautiful dawn. I had the Lickey Hills in my sights as the nearest proper off road from the centre of Birmignham. I just followed my nose initially as I knew that there was a canal path and Sustrans route that would get me close. I was hoping to tie in a little bridleway too.</p>
<p>It really was such alovely way to spend the last morning of the year, and even the cafe at the visitor centre being closed didn't dampen my spirits.</p>
<p>I engaged homing pigeon mode on the way back, there was something quite inspiring to have taken in both countryside and gritty urban scenery in one loop.</p>
<p>It was very muddy but there is the basics of a great loop there for when the nights get longer again, Clent is not much further which would create an epic loop!</p>
