### I love sourdough... it is by far my favourite type of bread and so when I read that you can make it from scratch using a wild yeast starter made of literally flour and water I decided I needed to try.

Turns out it isn't the easiest thing in the world to do.. it takes time and patience and even then could fail miserably. I started with good spirits, and following the starter recipe spent 5 days trying to create my starting point for the bread... sadly by Day 5 my starter smelt right but was not full of bubbles of carbon dioxide that would make it float in water.

Back to the drawing board, and as the Christmas Holidays landed I found I had the time to put into trying version two.

Look ma' it floats!

Success!! This was a moment to savour.. the test piece floated in water and so I could move on to making a Leaven.
