With every chord and riff it reminded me of the countless hours trying to learn the tabs for Mayonnaise, and failing miserably to replicate their sound by cutting out all the middle on my little Peavey practice amp and whacking the treble, bass and of course distortion on full.<!--more--></p>
<p>Some albums and bands seem to move seamlessly across decades, Maiden, Slayer and the likes of Hendrix seem to sound or at least fit in with the current time. I find this album does the opposite and pulls me back to  that alt rock / grunge period. I will always regret not seeing them live at that point. It was clear to see after watching Metallica at Glastonbury that it is always best to see a band in their prime!</p>
