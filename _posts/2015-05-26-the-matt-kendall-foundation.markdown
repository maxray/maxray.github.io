### Many young people have a plan to get into the world of work and can afford to pay for the equipment, training qualifications or support it takes to get there. But what about those that can’t?

Our founder, youth and community worker Matt Kendall, died from cancer aged just 35.  Knowing he didn’t have long, he set up the Foundation to carry on his work with young people in Birmingham to help them realise their potential.

As my daughter was in Matt's class at school I felt compelled to offer my skills to help get the Foundation website up and running as quickly as possible. 

There is lot's we would like to do going forward but for now we can spread the word and allow young people to apply for grants.
