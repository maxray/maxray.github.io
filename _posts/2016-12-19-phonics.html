<p>Off the back of doing the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-31-inktober %}">Inktober challenge</a> I wanted to set myself a new goal to work towards. My commute to work each day allowed me a nice 30 minute drawing slot on the train. Having also started getting really bored of the books my boy was bringing hme to aid learning letters I decided to do my own alphabet!</p><!--more-->

<h3>"A is for Apple, a, a, a."</h3>

<p>My concept was simple, although as it turned out a bit harder once I started getting to the more niche letters. Pair an animal with an unlikely situation or item. I started with "B for Bear" as I had been playing around with some bear sketches for some screen prints anyway.</p>

<p>This project is actually turning out to be quite a slow burner as I want a better final outcome. Perhaps I could turn it into an actual book or maybe a set of prints.</p>

<h3>The Alphabet according to Sush</h3>

<p>Here are a few of the final concepts, you can see them all on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sushphonicalphabet/" target="_blank">Instagram feed</a>.</p>
