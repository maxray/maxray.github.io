<p>I am so excited... like properly "woohoo!" excited. In a couple of weeks I will be doing silk screen printing for the first time in I don't know how long.</p>

<p>Actually I do know how long, about fifteen years but let's not worry about that right now.</p>
<p>The important thing is after about the same time being involved in digital design and development, I am finally going to be able to get back to my roots.</p>
<h3>The path least travelled.</h3>
<p>Although printing and the craft movement is in great health currently, for me it is a real break from the norm. Starting to play with actual pencils, paper and ink has been incredibly liberating, and maybe a little bit challenging.</p>
<p>I have been trying to get back into it by doing a daily <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/traindoodle/" target="_blank" >#traindoodle</a> on my 25min journey to work. This has given me a regular albeit small period of time each day to focus.</p>
<p>I heard about <a href="http://birminghamprintmakers.org/" target="_blank" >Birmingham Printmakers</a> just before Christmas, it sounds like a brilliant resource and I am really looking forward to getting a membership once I have had my refresher day and orientation lesson.</p>
<p>In the meantime I need to develop my idea as I get to do a 2 colour A4 print as part of the workshop.</p>
