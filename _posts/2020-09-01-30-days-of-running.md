### What could possibly go wrong! After being 16 seconds off my personal goal of a 25min 5k before lockdown I haven't run since. So obviously the best way to jump start things is by trying to run in some form for every day in September.

I like to have some accountability so am documenting each day here. Come share my pain with me!

#### Day 1 (Interval run 3.66km in 26.44)

Well... that was no fun AT ALL. Everything felt wrong and even though I have been walking and cycling over the last few months there is a definite hardening needed for the body to do the running.

#### Day 2 - Meg Run (Interval run 3.44km in 27.10)

Convinced my daughter to come out with me this morning, things felt better than yesterday which was a huge relief and surprisingly didn't feel too bad in my legs - I was expecting to be walking like John Wayne.

#### Day 3 (Interval run 3.74km in 26.03)

Decided to do the same sprint/walk internal route all week and then maybe try a longer gentle run on the weekend. Legs felt good again and really tried to focus on good form during the high intensity intervals. Looking back to February I was managing around 4k in a similar time doing this specific run so I am not miles off being back to where I was. Will be interesting to see what my first proper 5km run comes in at.

#### Day 4 - Meg Run (Interval run 3.47km in 29.41)

Used a foam roller last night because my lower calf felt a bit tender. Running again with Meg today and tbh I felt i was lacking energy. Bad eating yesterday and the consecutives runs are the reason I am assuming. Interestingly though highest Max Speed so far of 21.4km/h and Max Pace of 2:48 min/km. Thinking interval route tomorrow and then try a 5k Sat and a gentle warm down run Sunday.

#### Day 5 - (Interval run 3.86km in 26.17)

Usually I fall out of bed and get my exercise done but as this is a sustained period of doing it every day I have decided to have my morning coffee and come to beforehand. It does mean I seem to be having my "morning coffee" on my return also. /0\

Felt a little twinge in my right calf so backed off a little during the high intensity intervals but felt pretty good at the end. Five days down and the weekend brings just a normal run and gentle warm down run on Saturday.

### What constitutes a run?

I hadn't really thought about this at the start but I haven't decided what counts as a run. My feeling is that 1mile sounds like a sensible minimum so will aim for a minimum 2km each time.

#### Day 6 (Normal run 5.02km in 28.17)

First 5km run since February so am pretty happy with the time. Legs felt tired near the end and laps of the park are pretty boring!! Meg had her best run yet - won't be long before she is waiting for me to catch up.

Legs pretty tight on getting home, foam roller tonight.

#### Day 7 (Recovery run 2.03km in 12.47)

Sunday was always going to be about keeping the sequence going so just a gentle run for the minimum 2km self imposed distance. Legs didn't really fancy it al all although by the end of the run I probably felt better! I had a fancifull idea about plogging (where you pick litter and jog) but couldn't get my head around running with a litter grabber and bag... one for the future I think.

Back to intervals tomorrow.

#### Day 8 (Interval run 3.67km in 26.17)

Possibly too many Sunday night drinks meant a heavy head today.. but still got out and did the run. Nothing to report, felt rubbish - was rubbish! :)

#### Day 9 - Meg run (Interval run 3.07km in 26.53)

Wonder if I am getting a bit of a cold? Would be no surprise as the youngest has been back in school for 4 days :/ Felt odd last night and had a bad sleep, keeping contact with Meg on her c25k session so not pushing the distance as she wanted to ensure she got home to get ready for school.

### Third of the way!

#### Day 10 (Interval run 4.12km in 26.12)

I decided the 10th day marks a good point to start eliminating any walking from my intervals. Initially I was doing sprints and walks so today I decided to do the sprints at a speed I would love to be able to run at and then where possible jog the recovery phases. Today the pattern was run - jog - run - walk - run - jog - walk - run etc. Interestingly my highest speed was only 16km/h but I managedmy longest distance on the interval runs so far.

I am sure there a more scientific ways to measure/log my progress but writing it down each day is making me feel accountable.

Probably the first day so far I could have carried on also!

#### Day 11 (Recovery run 2.75km)

After some wise words from [@aswifthaIf](https://twitter.com/aswifthaIf) on Twitter I am re jigging my runs a little. The runs with my daughter Tues/Thurs and a Sunday are recovery runs leaving a 5k on a Saturday and intervals Mon/Wed/Fri.

Hoping this will let me improve AND get through the 30 days.

#### Day 12 (Interval run 4.27km in 26.11) (800m - 03.11)

Well I felt lots stronger than last Friday, and as we worked out an 800m marker yesterday I decided to see what time I could do, perhaps this will be a regular Friday thing?? I was guessing that it would take me about 4mins based on 5min/km pace but managed to do 3minutes 11 which I was pretty pleased about. Seems like a natural target there to try and get sub 3 by the end of the month.
