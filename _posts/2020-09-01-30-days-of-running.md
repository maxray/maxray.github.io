### What could possibly go wrong! After being 16 seconds off my personal goal of a 25min 5k before lockdown I haven't run since. So obviously the best way to jump start things is by trying to run in some form for every day in September.

I like to have some accountability so am documenting each day here even though I might not actually get to post thisat the time (new site in progress).

#### Day 1 (Interval run 3.66km in 26.44)

Well... that was no fun AT ALL. Everything felt wrong and even though I have been walking and cycling over the last few months there is a definite hardening needed for the body to do the running. 

#### Day 2 - Meg Run (Interval run 3.44km in 27.10) 

Convinced my daughter to come out with me this morning, things felt better than yesterday which was a huge relief and surprisingly didn't feel too bad in my legs - I was expecting to be walking like John Wayne. 

#### Day 3 (Interval run 3.74km in 26.03)

Decided to do the same sprint/walk internal route all week and then maybe try a longer gentle run on the weekend. Legs felt good again and really tried to focus on good form during the high intensity intervals. Looking back to February I was managing around 4k in a similar time doing this specific run so I am not miles off being back to where I was. Will be interesting to see what my first proper 5km run comes in at. 

#### Day 4 - Meg Run (Interval run 3.47km in 29.41)

Used a foam roller last night because my lower calf felt a bit tender. Running again with Meg today and tbh I felt i was lacking energy. Bad eating yesterday and the consecutives runs are the reason I am assuming. Interestingly though highest Max Speed so far of 21.4km/h and Max Pace of 2:48 min/km. Thinking interval route tomorrow and then try a 5k Sat and a gentle warm down run Sunday. 

#### Day 5 - (Interval run 3.86km in 26.17)

Usually I fall out of bed and get my exercise done but as this is a sustained period of doing it every day I have decided to have my morning coffee and come to beforehand. It does mean I seem to be having my "morning coffee" on my return also. /0\

Felt a little twinge in my right calf so backed off a little during the high intensity intervals but felt pretty good at the end. Five days down and the weekend brings just a normal run and gentle warm down run on Saturday.

### What constitutes a run? 

I hadn't really thought about this at the start but I haven't decided what counts as a run. My feeling is that 1mile sounds like a sensible minimum so will aim for a minimum 2km each time.
