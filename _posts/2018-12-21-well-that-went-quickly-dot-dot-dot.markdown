### As yet another year draws to a close I am finishing off a few last amends for clients and sorting out clearing my desk for Christmas. Who knows I might even manage to get my inbox emptied over the break!

It has been a pretty down and up year and one in which I finally went freelance to explore new opportunities. Bad organisation and a very odd chain of events meant doing this with no safety net built up or any real preparation meant I had to hit the ground running... I am so grateful to a few of my pals on Twitter who pointed me in the direction of some freelance work literally days after I mentioned I was available and the those initial client's who paid invoices promptly and sometimes even ahead of time.

As the year progressed I have worked on some great projects including an ethical fashion brand, something I would love to build upon in 2019. Environmental issues are something close to my heart and I also started a side project company, delivering plastic free produce via cargo cycle. Although ultimately this did not work out from a time/finance perspective I learnt so much about running a business, and seeing things with the eyes of a client will really assist with the digital projects I work on going forward.

I spent the last quarter of the year contracting at a digital agency in Birmingham part time. It felt really weird being both the 'new guy' and the 'old guy' at the same time but they welcomed me in and it has been a real highlight to work with such driven and talented people. Working their as both a producer and a digital lead has been great as I have got to keep my dev skills sharp whilst helping to guide and manage the projects going through the studio.

So, what will the New Year bring? Who knows but I for one am excited as to what 2019 will bring for myself and the clients who have helped me finish the year with a smile on my face... I owe you all a beer. :)
