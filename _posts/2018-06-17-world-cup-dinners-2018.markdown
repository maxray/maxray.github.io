### Having followed Sally Lait's [World Cup Dinners](https://sallylait.com/labs/worldcup2018dinners/) for a couple of tournaments, I decided to have a go this year to add some fun to the football and our meal choices! 

I can't decide how I am going to document things so for now, I am keeping the first few days here.

Day 1 for my was actually Day 2 but hey shhhh..  :) 

### Day 1 - IRAN

A little searching brought up Khoresh Bademjan, but the recipe used Sour grapes which I could not find. Thankfully some more searching showed that you can substitute with unripe gooseberries which I could get.

This is a beef and aubergine stew essentially and I followed this [recipe](https://persianmama.com/khoresh-bademjan-persian-eggplant-stew-with-beef/).


### Day 2 - FRANCE

It had been a busy day and there was arguments about what we were having for dinner anyway. Decided to go safe so we chose [chicken chasseur](https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/_chicken_chasseur_with_19163). It is years since I have had it and it hit the spot! I think this one will be returning to the family meal list.

### Day 3 - SWITZERLAND

Sunday dinner was not going to be missed, so we decided on a pudding instead.. Swiss meringues. Biggest fail ever, me and Meg making an absolute hash of it all and ending up with a sticky, gooey, tasty mess that wasn't really close to what it should have been.

### Day 4 - TUNISIA

We do a slightly lax 5:2 eating regime in our house so Monday was just a light supper... best find so far! [Shaksuka](http://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/shakshuka) is kind of like baked eggs in a tomato and pepper base.

### Day 5 - EGYPT

I seem to be in the habit of cursing the team I pick in this fun game, Egypt played poorly but this recipe with [courgettes and a dukkah sprinkle](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/egyptian-courgettes-dukkah-sprinkle) was really interesting and also vegan if that's your thing.

### Day 6 - SPAIN

The pressure of new meals was getting to me a bit so took an easy option of Paella. What's not to like.. rice, sea food ooh and some chorizo :P

### Day 7 - PERU

Back to a semi fast day, so although [Tacu Tacu](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/tacu-tacu/) is often used as a side with a meat main I thought we should try it having never eaten Plantain. What a revelation, fried plantain was much more like potato than I expected. The hot sauce and chilli made this one that the kids were reluctant to get involved with. :) 

Apparently this is a good hangover meal too, though I could imagine it partnering with a crisp IPA myself.

And so ends Week 1 of the World Cup, some great games, and England victory and some lovely new additions to our family recipes. Let's hope for more of the same next week!
