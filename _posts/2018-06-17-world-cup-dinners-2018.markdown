*** Having followed Sally Lait's [World Cup Dinners](https://sallylait.com/labs/worldcup2018dinners/) for a couple of tournaments, I decided to have a go this year to add some fun to the football and our meal choices! 

I can't decide how I am going to document things so for now, I am keeping the first few days here. 

Day 1 for my was actually Day 2 but hey shhhh..  :) 

*** Day 1 - IRAN

A little searching brought up Khoresh Bademjan, but the recipe used Sour grapes which I could not find. Thankfully some more searching showed that you can substitute with unripe gooseberries which I could get.

This is a beef and aubergine stew essentially and I followed this [recipe](https://persianmama.com/khoresh-bademjan-persian-eggplant-stew-with-beef/).


*** Day 2 - FRANCE

It had been a busy day and there was arguments about what we were having for dinner anyway. Decided to go safe so we chose [chicken chasseur](https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/_chicken_chasseur_with_19163). It is years since I have had it and it hit the spot! I think this one will be returning to the family meal list.
