### Well.. it has been a little while, life, side projects and as I finally realised my favourite text editor acting as a stealth blocker to my blog writing.

It is more the realisation that I have become totally reliant on in browser spell checking to help me keep my grammar in check. As much as moving to Jekyll had been a fun experiment, the act of writing blog posts in a text editor was a struggle.

I have a few posts that have been sitting waiting to be written so time to play catch up!
