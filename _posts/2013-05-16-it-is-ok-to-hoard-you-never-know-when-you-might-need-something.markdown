<p>People say a tidy desk tidy mind and the like and as much as I try to adhere to this tidy and clean way of existing I can't help stashing bits and bobs that seem like they might be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I'm not like a person you would see on the telly living in filth with 3feet of rubbish everywhere but as a designer I have a habit of keeping pictures, magazines and images in a badly organised fashion. I also love gadgets and so there are countless old phones, hard drives and pc/mac bits and bobs like an elephants graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>So today I was so pleased that for once my stashing and hoarding turned up trumps.<!--more--></strong></p>
<p>I arrived into work to a "no wireless connection" icon, no network, no interweb... things were not looking good. So began some rudimentary bug chasing to try and find out what the problem was.</p>
<p>Finally after some messing around I determined that the switch that ties the wireless box, load balancer and servers together was not working. I was just about to set off to PC World to find a replacement when I thought... "my Aladdins cave of wires!". A quick rummage round and I found a power adaptor from a long since redundant switch which by chance fitted and suddenly everything was alright with the world again.</p>
<p>For a change instead of feeling guilty about my stash I now feel vindicated! :)</p>
