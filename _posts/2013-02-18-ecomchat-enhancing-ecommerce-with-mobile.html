<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23ecomchat" target="_blank">#ecomchat</a> is a weekly Twitter chat on eCommerce. Each week 2 or 3 points are set up for discussion. This week it was:
<ul>
<li>What are the big trends in how people use mobile devices to interact with brands?</li>
<li>What are the in-store opportunities for multi-channel brands like John Lewis? And for smaller brands?</li>
<li>What technology needs to be in place to manage this?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>One of the posts that grabbed my attention was a brief conversation about in store oppurtunities for mobile interaction. Off the back of it I ended up being pointed in the direction of <a href="http://www.podifi.com/podifi-technology/the-pod" target="_blank">Podifi</a>. I love the fact it plugs into existing hardware and (depending on cost) could be a great marketing tool for businesses looking to interact with their customers via mobile technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23ecomchat" target="_blank">#ecomchat</a> was set up by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danbarker">@danbarker</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jamesgurd">@jamesgurd</a> as a simple way to get people together to chat about ecommerce, it is well worth checking out!</p>
