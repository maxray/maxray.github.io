<p>Now I could be referring to many things, road cycling, Return of the Jedi or even those pesky Ipswich footy fans. In this case though I am referring to print.</p>

<p>As a designer who works around 98% on screen only I am unaware of the tricks and techniques of print design. This gives it an almost mythical quality that I rarely get when I look at a website nowadays. <!--more--> The feel of the page, the smell of the ink and the luscious photography.. all contained within a finite package that won't be tweaked endlessly or amended, that won't look different to another set of eyes and is just sitting there waiting for you to pick it up whenever you feel like it.</p>
<p>Perhaps working in websites has destroyed their charm, all too quickly I am dragging my browser window around to see how the page reacts with regards to RWD, opening Firebug to have a look at how it was coded and generally ruining the illusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need to take a step back occasionally and enjoy a website how it was intended! For now though I will carrying on pawing through the issue of <a href="http://www.rouleur.cc/" target="_blank">Rouleur</a> I picked up at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bikelounge&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#bikelounge</a> last night...</p>
