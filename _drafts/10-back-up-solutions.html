<div>The nightmare scenario... working away, getting into a piece of design work then... "Sorry Photoshop has quit unexpectedly..."  there goes 3 hours work. We all know we should save regularly when working but it is even more important  that we back up our work. It is one thing to lose 3 hours but another to lose all the projects you have been working on for a client! Let's look at 10 great tools to back up your work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Toughdrive</div>
<div>A robust solution which is great if you move around a lot on trains or bicycles.  It can survive a 2m drop (I havent tested this out) and the integrated USB cable is a great piece of design both in terms of the life of the connector in the back of the unit and the fact you never forget your lead.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. My Passport</div>
<div>Although slightly more delicate, the Western Digital My Passport is more affordable than the Toughdrive. The fact you can now get 2TB capacity  harddrives like this for less than £110 shows how far we have come to in terms of the cost of storage.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Iomega Home Media Network Hard Drive</div>
<div>A reliable home network storage system which includes the ability to act as a personal cloud server. You can share your files between all your computers. It’s quite fast, and the simple set-up is ideal if you’ve never used a network drive before.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4. Drobo</div>
<div>A cost effective NAS solution, the Drobo is a step up in terms of back ups. It isn't as fast as a top end unit like a Lacie Big One but this is outweighed by it's cost. It will do a great job of serving files and protecitng your back up using RAID. A redundant array of independent disks, or RAID, is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple drives.</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. Synology DS213 Air</div>
<div>This lovely looking drive is specifically designed for small office and home users who need the convenient solution of wireless sharing capability with full-featured network attached storage. At around £250 plus the cost of the drives, it isn't cheap but it will provide a long term back up facility.</div>
<div></div>
<div>6. Dropbox</div>
<div>Dropbox is an online data backup service that lets you store up to 100GB,  it’s also a good way to sync your files across your various work and home computers and mobile devices. Your data is also backed up on Dropbox's secure servers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>7. Google Drive</div>
<div>Cloud systems all act in a similar way, Google's version of Dropbox is Drive. You get 5Gb of storage for free  and then when you reach your limit, get another 25 GB of space  starting at around $3 per month. There was a lot of comotion about Drive's Ts and Cs when it first came out but this seems to have subsided.</div>
<div></div>
<div>8. iCloud</div>
<div>Apple offer iCloud now with all their devices. It is Mac only but does offer a total solution in terms of syncronising and backing up your data on you iPhone/iPad and Mac computer. The 5gb of free space is not affected by the items you buy such as books and apps, it is there for your mail, and documents which is good. iCloud has been in the news recently regarding Apple reserving the right to delete content they don't agree with from your account.</div>
<div></div>
<div>9. Mac software - Chronosync</div>
<div>Although this is a paid for piece of software it offers a really easy  way to syncronise or back up to your drive of choice. You can set up a regular back up that happens at a certain time which allows you to set it to do it's thing whilst you sleep each night.</div>
<div></div>
<div>10. PC software - SyncToy</div>
<div>A freeware .NET program by Microsoft that allows easy syncronisation of your files to your back up device of choice. It is very similar to Chronosync, just choose your left and right targets and decide what method of backup you want.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whichever back up solution you choose, make sure you use it! A client phoned me in a panic the other day. They had done a system restore on a pc and their files had disappeared  I asked if it was backed up they said yes... but only up to August. Needless to say they will be much more attentive to their back up procedures in future! The key is to get into a regular routine, do this and you won't have to worry about data loss again.</div>
