<p>I sometimes feel like I am adrift on a little raft... floating in a sea of frameworks, plugins, widgets and blogging tools. It can feel quite overwhelming and leave you wondering "should I be using this or that", "I better learn this tech.. no that one" etc</p>
<p>Whilst it is good to stay abreast of the Â trends and developments on the web you should try and avoid dipping in and out of them so much that you never really have a preferred method of doing things.</p>
