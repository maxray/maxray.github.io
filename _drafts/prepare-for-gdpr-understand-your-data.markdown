### By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail

One of those usually annoying quotes, but in this case it does hold value. 

Following on from my initial post about what GDPR essentially is I thought it would be good to work through the basic requirements to make sure you are ready come the end of May.

### Understand your data

The very first part of the process is to look at the data you hold as a company. Things we need to note here is, 

* What data are you collecting?
* How are you collecting it?
* Where is it/backups stored?
* How are you using the data

What - 

How - are you using the correct opt ins on forms, are you obtaining email addresses in an incorrect way

Where is it stored, is it secure, can you access it to delete it or find it if needed where are your back ups (some are ok)

What are you doing with it?
