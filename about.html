    	<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h3>I have been involved in website design and development since the late 90s. Battling with Internet Explorer 6, table layouts and shims has caused me to thrive off the developments and progression the industry has made over the last 20 years.</h3>
		<p>I currently cover three main roles at the agency I work for; Digital Director, Front End specialist and friendly office janitor! It is safe to say I have had to become quite the generalist to cover these roles. If you are interested you can read more about my specific skills and experience <a href="/cv/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>My original passion is illustration, mainly pen and ink. I am a member of the Birmingham Printmakers and try to experiment with screen printing when I can.</p>
		<p>I shy away from speaking but enjoy writing, producing articles for Creativebloq and .Net magazine amongst others.</p>
