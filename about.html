		<h3>I am a freelance designer/developer based in Birmingham.</h3> <p>I have been involved in website design and development since 2000. From battling with Internet Explorer 6, table layouts and shims to the comparitave joys that css-grid is giving us.</p><p>The developments and progression the industry has made over the last 20 years is what makes me tick.</p>

		<h3>Ongoing projects</h3>
			<p>My original passion is illustration, mainly pen and ink. I am a member of the Birmingham Printmakers and try to experiment with screen printing when I can.</p>
		<p>I enjoy writing, producing articles for Creativebloq and .Net magazine amongst others.</p>
		<p>Getting involved in <a href="https://www.birminghambeerweek.uk" target="_blank">Birmingham Beer Week</a> last year was fun, as it's first year it needed to step up after the successes of the Beer Bash previously. We have big things planned for this year!</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://themattkendallfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Matt Kendall Foundation</a> is a charity that aims to give young people a foot onto the ladder when they really need it. The brain child of Matt who sadly died after a battle with cancer, this is his legacy. With daughters in the same class I felt compelled to offer any help I could to get them up and running. Despite it being 'thrown together' in a very short space of time it has already helped people in need which is no bad thing :) </p>
