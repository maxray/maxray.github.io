    	<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h3>I have been involved in website design and development since 2000. From battling with Internet Explorer 6, table layouts and shims to the comparitave joys that css-grid is giving us, the developments and progression the industry has made over the last 20 years is what makes me tick.</h3>
		<p>I currently cover three main roles at a Creative Studio in Leamington Spa; Digital Director, Front End specialist and friendly office janitor! It is safe to say I have had to become quite the generalist to cover these roles. If you are interested you can read more about my specific skills and experience <a href="/cv/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>I am also available for specific projects, consultancy or general advice in a freelance capacity.</p>
		<p>My original passion is illustration, mainly pen and ink. I am a member of the Birmingham Printmakers and try to experiment with screen printing when I can.</p>
		<p>I shy away from speaking but enjoy writing, producing articles for Creativebloq and .Net magazine amongst others.</p>
