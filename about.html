    	<h1>About Me</h1>
    	<h3>Well what can I say...</h3>

		<p>I have been involved in website design and development since the late 90s. I have battled with Netscape Communicator, table layouts and shims and thrive off the developments and progression the industry has made over the years.</p>
		<p>I currently wear three hats in my work; Digital Director of a small agency, a Front End specialist and friendly office janitor! It is safe to say I have had to become quite the generalist to cover these roles. If you are interested you can read more about my specific skills and experience <a href="/cv/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>My original passion is illustration, mainly pen and ink. I am also a member of the Birmingham Printmakers and try to experiment with screen printing when I can.</p>
		<p>I enjoy writing, although my quality is probably debateable! Nevertheless I have written some articles for Creativebloq and .Net magazine amongst others.</p>
