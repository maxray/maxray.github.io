          <h1 class="contact-title">I am a freelance designer & developer based in Birmingham.</h1> 
          <p>I love working things through logically, a robust process is key to making sure the outcome is what you expect. To begin, a discussion over a coffee is great to find out about the project and its objectives. Then it is about gathering information and thinking about how we will approach things from the users perspective. </p>
