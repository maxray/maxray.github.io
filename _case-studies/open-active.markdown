preamble: |
  OpenActive is a community led initiative using data to help people get active in order to help reduce inactivity in England. Stewarded by the Open Data Institute (ODI) and supported by Sport England, its ambition is to get the sport and physical activity sector to publish and use data about the details of opportunities to be active. The data includes activity sessions, clubs, classes and facilities, along with enough information to help people decide whether a particular activity right for them. By making this data open, more innovative services like apps, community services and websites can use it to help promote activities. 

  As the community grew, the ODI needed a new website that could serve its evolving needs. It required a practical hub for the community to attract new members, provide interactive tools and resources which help members publish and use data and keep the community engaged and informed of the initiativeâ€™s progress.
