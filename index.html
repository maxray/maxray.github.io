          <h3>Websites</h3>
          <p>I can design and build you a website that will fit your needs now and in the future.</p><p>The principles and thinking that are behind great website trancend the choice of CMS. Quite alot of people end up choosing Wordpress for a variety of reasons, but there are lotts of other ways to reach your goal.</p>

          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p>Sometimes it is far easier to engage a design agency on a website rebuild if you have someone on your team who knows what they are talking about!</p><p>Having worked with agencies over the years I can help your internal team with their digital projects. There is a great deal you can do internally before you go out to get a quote.</p>
