Bank Holidays are good when you are employed but not so much when you are freelance! Had planned for this one anyway as it is Megs birthday so enjoyed a proper family day. 

The weekend was interspersed with a few website dramas after having to launch a site just before the weekend.. lessons to be learned there! 

Progress is good on the flooring website I am working on and I am in the design phase of a record label site which should be pretty fun!

Ended the week with the Birmingham Design Festival volunteer meeting - going to help out again as really enjoyed it last year.
