Feels great to start the week without injury! Lot's to be done as away at the Isle of Man next week for some TT fun. 

Had a great kick off meeting with a new client at Sixth Story. They are so open . to our advice and up for tackling the job in nice bite size chunks to get all the functionality nailed down before we go anywhere near design. 

No responses on the podcast or contact regards some new work so threw myself into Snipcart and a new Jekyll build for the record label site I am working on. 

In a few hours I had put together a Jekyll install, linked it to Github Pages and implemented Snipcart... meanwhile the design side has progressed well so hopefully I can get a proper build on the go.
