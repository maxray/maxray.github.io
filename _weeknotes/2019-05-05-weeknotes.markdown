## Week commencing 29th April 

This week has been a busy one as it is both my daughters and my own birthday on the weekend AND a Bank Holiday!

I have been working on:

* A design for a record label
* The beginning of a build for a flooring website 
* Helping the team at Sixth Story with a massive website launch
